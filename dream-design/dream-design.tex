\noindent A proposed interface design for an improved experience while playing first person shooters on mobile devices. This investigation will indicate the weaknesses of interfaces currently used in mobile first person shooters. The interface proposed seeks to alleviate usability issues and weaknesses that arise in many games of the related genre. With intuitive controls and a well organized layout, it will present the best possible experience for mobile first person shooter players.

\section{Introuction} Within recent years, the gaming market for mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, has seen a surge in popularity as well as the number of titles available for play. Between 2013 and 2014, mobile phone gaming revenue for both Apple's iOS app store and Google's play store increased by over 50\%. The significant growth of the mobile gaming market has resulted in the constant release of titles of varying genres, each competing for the attention of consumers. One of the most competetive genres within the market is the first person shooter, which contains a plethora of titles ranging from military shooters to zombie survival. Though similar in terms of gameplay, many studios differ in how they have tackled the challenge of presenting an effective interface design for their respective games. One example of the difficulties in such a task is the lack of hardware devices, like a mouse or controller, that many gamers are familiar with using when playing first person shooters. The design proposed will demonstrate how an intelligent layout and an onubtrusive interface can enhance the overall gaming experience.
