\begin{abstract}
\noindent A proposed interface design for an improved experience while playing three dimensional first person shooters on mobile devices. This investigation will indicate the weaknesses of interfaces currently used in mobile first person shooters. The interface proposed seeks to alleviate usability issues and weaknesses that arise in many games of the related genre. With intuitive controls and a well organized layout, it will present the best possible experience for mobile first person shooter players.
