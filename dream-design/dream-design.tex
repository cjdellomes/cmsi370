\noindent This study proposes an ideal user interface design utilizing the Reddit API. The design is meant to address the issue of navigation confusion by new users and enhance the presentation of information. Borrowing ideas from other popular websites, conforming to popular interface guidelines, and implementing voice based features, the design will provide the best possible experience for redditors.

\section{Introuction} When reddit.com launched back in June of 2005, it was a small social network site based on users submitting and voting on text posts and posted links. Over time, as Reddit implemented more features, such as giving users the ability to comment and create their own subredits, the number of redditors and subreddits grew exponentially. As of October 2015, Reddit has 202 million unique visitors and over 800,000 subreddits, making reddit in the top 50 most popular web sites in the world. With the growing popularity of Reddit, the analysis of the site's current layout and the development of an improved user interface is a significant research topic.

\section{System Description} The design will utilize the Reddit API to allow users to post links and text submissions, make new subreddits, comment, and vote like the original site. However, the interface will present the content and allow users to interact with the content in a more natural and accessible manner. This investigation presents an ideal user interface design for the Reddit API that focuses on improving site navigation and adding voice functionality. The improved site navigation is designed in a manner that is meant to maintain navigation efficiency while making it easier to learn how to interact with the site, such as creating a subreddit and exploring subreddits. The proposed interface is also designed with voice command functionality implemented for nonphysical site navigation and interaction, which is especially accomodating to physically impaired users. 
\\
\indent The interface will implement voice recognition technology, similar to Siri for iOS or Cortana for Windows 10, in order for users to directly manipulate content. On the original site, each post has an index, a net score of upvotes, comments with each one also having a net score of upvotes, and a subreddit which it was posted to. With voice recognition technology, navigating and interacting would be possible through voice commands, such as ``upvote post 1'', ``downvote comment by user Unidan'', ``go to the movies subreddit'', and ``post this text message...''. Integrating such technology into the reddit interface would allow users to control their reddit experience without requiring a mouse and keyboard.\\
\\
\indent While voice functionality is available, the proposed interface would still have an overall smooth sense of flow for users utilizing the traditional mouse and keyboard setup. The interface will coordinate with the Reddit API to ensure users remain capable of standard user abilities, like voting and posting. However, the interface will improve upon the current layout of Reddit's site by adopting aspects of other popular websites and popularly accepted interface guidelines, such as the OSX Human Guidelines and Google Material Design Principles.
