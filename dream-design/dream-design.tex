\begin{abstract}
\noindent This study proposes an ideal user interface design utilizing the Reddit API. The design is meant to address the issue of navigation confusion by new users and enhance the presentation of information. Borrowing ideas from other popular websites and conforming to popular interface guidelines, the design will provide the best possible experience for redditors.

\section{Introuction} When reddit.com launched back in June of 2005, it was a small social network site based on users submitting and voting on text posts and posted links. Over time, as Reddit implemented more features, such as giving users the ability to comment and create their own subredits, the number of redditors and subreddits grew exponentially. As of October 2015, Reddit has 202 million unique visitors and over 800,000 subreddits, making reddit in the top 50 most popular web sites in the world. With the growing popularity of Reddit, the analysis of the site's current layout and the development of an improved user interface is a significant research topic.
